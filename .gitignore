# Some next steps:
# "amplify status" will show you what you've added already and if it's locally configured or deployed
# "amplify add <category>" will allow you to add features like user login or a backend API
# "amplify push" will build all your local backend resources and provision it in the cloud
# "amplify console" to open the Amplify Console and view your project status
# "amplify publish" will build all your local backend and frontend resources (if you have hosting category added) and provision it in the cloud

Pro tip:
Try "amplify add api" to create a backend API and then "amplify push" to deploy everything
